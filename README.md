## About

SwiftUI is an innovative, exceptionally simple way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift in Xcode. In this workshop, you will move your first steps to master these powerful developer tools.

<br />

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/developer-academy-unina/Workshop-Introducing-SwiftUI
   ```

2. Open the ```.xcodeproj``` file

### How to

1. The PizzaApp project is part of the "Introducing SwiftUI" Workshop.
It is a semi-complete app. The project deliberately presents only a graphical interface that can be easily reproduced by dragging and dropping components from Xcode's Library.  
PizzaApp is used to guide students in getting familiar with the Xcode different areas: Navigator, Editor, Inspector, Toolbar, Canvas, and Debug area.

2. The PresentMe project is part of the "Introducing SwiftUI" Workshop.
After they got familiar with the Xcode different areas, students are challenged in creating a PresentMe version of themselves.
This project presents an example of an App that students are expected to create. A simple View presenting an image and texts describing them.  
Thanks to the PresentMe Challenge, students learn how to build simple interfaces using the SwiftUI components from the Library: views and modifier.
